Welcome on board. Most of my productive time is split betwen some exciting mathematics and attempts at poetry and short prose. This site will serve as a public repository for these ventures. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
